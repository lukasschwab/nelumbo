        <h2 class="place">Berkeley, California</h2>
        <p> One stormy night, hunched over in his lab at UC Berkeley, Bay Area Kairos Society Fellow and all around pal Liam Berryman discovered a new material with new properties. That's kind of the point of materials sciences, isn't it?</p><br>
        <p>We use a thin superomniphobic nanocoating on air conditioning cooling coil fins to accelerate water and oil shedding, eliminating the common issues of decreased energy efficiency and contaminant build-up.</p><br>
        <p>Our OMNIPHOBE&trade; coating is thermally conductive, 200x thinner than a human hair, and costs less than 2% of an AC unit.</p>
        <p>That means universal application on any scale or geometry.</p><br>
        <p>Cool?</p>

        <p>A great landing page is succint while providing sufficient
        information to convert viewers. Overloading parties with text is
        doesn't further the objective. On the contrary, being too cryptic,
        ambiguous or unclear due to brevity sets one back as well. The
        prerogative is to communicate to the viewer why this solution is the

        <p>The trick of a great landing page is to be succint but yet provide

        hurts the effort. Primary effort is to communicate to the viewer why
        this solution is the best. Do it!</p>
