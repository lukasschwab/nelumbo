# Nelumbo website

Created with a little help from [LandingStrip](https://github.com/vidbina/landing-strip/tree/master/joinsupport), but is heavily modified.

It's a website for a Berkeley materials startup called Nelumbo, run by a Kairos pal of mine.

## To do

+ New font
+ Real copy
+ Header image/texture (too boring)
+ Favicon
